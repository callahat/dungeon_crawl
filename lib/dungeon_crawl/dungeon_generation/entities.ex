  Entities are a more broadly defined class of tiles that can appear in a solo autogenerated dungeon.
  When an entity tile is placed in a generated dungeon, there should also be a "floor" tile placed
  beneath it, otherwise there will be a "hole" in the map should the entity move or die.
  Entities can include monsters as well as items.
